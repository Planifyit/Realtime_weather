# Weather Widget

This repository contains the code for a custom weather widget that can be used in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). This widget fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the widget up and running in your SAC application.

### Prerequisites

You need to have an account on SAP Analytics Cloud and access to create and manage custom widgets.

### Deployment

1. Create a public Github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

2. Add the `WeatherWidget.js` and `WeatherWidget.json` files to this repository.

3. Navigate to the custom widgets section in your SAC application and upload the `WeatherWidget.json` file.

### Usage

Once the widget is successfully imported into SAC, you can use it in any SAC Analytical Application. To use the widget:

1. Create a new SAC Analytical Application.

2. In the builder panel, you will find the weather widget under the 'Custom Widgets' section.

3. Drag and drop the widget onto the canvas.

Now, you should see real-time weather data being displayed by your widget.
